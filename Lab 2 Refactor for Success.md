# Lab 2: Refactor for Success

## Refactoring Data Loading Logic

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

Download the Titanic dataset to your project folder:
[Titanic Dataset CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-introduction-to-machine-learning/main/Data/titanic.csv)

---

### Step 2: Refactor Data Loading (Edit Mode)


### 🎯 Prompt (Edit Mode)

```
Refactor the data loading logic in the notebook so that it is encapsulated in a function. This function should:
- Attempt to load the Titanic dataset from a local file in the data directory by default.
- If the local file does not exist, load the data from the provided URL.
- Move this function to a new Python file.
Be sure to follow best practices for code organization and reproducibility.
```

### Step 3: Test the Code

Test the code after refactoring. Did it work? If not, try to fix the error using GitHub Copilot (Right-click → Copilot → Fix) or use the "Sparkles" icon next to the error.

---

### Step 4: Extract Configuration

Let's go further and extract the configurations:

Add both files as context (the function and the function call).


### 🎯 Prompt (Edit Mode)

```
Refactor the `load_titanic_data` function so that the default values for `local_path` and `url` are imported from a separate configuration module.
```

---

## Testing (Agent Mode)

Open the file with the `load_titanic_data` function.


### 🎯 Prompt (Agent Mode)

```
/tests load_titanic_data function and confirm that all tests pass successfully
```

### Explain Using Inline Chat

Browse through the generated code. Do you want an explanation of the created code? Select the code block, use inline chat (Ctrl + I), use the `/explain` command, or use the context menu (right-click → Copilot).
