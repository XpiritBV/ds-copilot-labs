# Titanic Survival Predictor: A Hands-on Data Science Lab Series with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Predictor labs! In this hands-on series, youâ€™ll use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code in the context of data science. 

Starting from scratch, youâ€™ll work through labs covering data exploration, cleaning and modeling, and building an interactive prediction app. Along the way, youâ€™ll learn to leverage Copilot Chatâ€™s different modes (Ask, Edit, Agent) to speed up your workflow and follow best practices in data science

## Get to Know Copilot Chat â€” Modes at a Glance

| Mode | Best-for Tasks (lab-relevant examples) | Typical Actions & Example Prompts |
|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Ask** | â€¢ Explaining unfamiliar code blocks or ML concepts<br>â€¢ Clarifying dataset columns (e.g., `sibsp`, `parch`, `embarked`)<br>â€¢ Interpreting matplotlib/seaborn visualizations<br>â€¢ Understanding model performance metrics<br>â€¢ Getting data science best practices<br>â€¢ Troubleshooting errors and warnings | *"Explain what `sibsp` and `parch` columns represent in the Titanic dataset."*<br>*"Why is my correlation heatmap showing NaN values?"*<br>*"What's the difference between precision and recall for survival prediction?"*<br>*"How do I interpret this ROC curve?"*<br>*"What does this pandas warning about chained assignment mean?"* |
| **Edit** | â€¢ Refactoring notebook cells into reusable functions<br>â€¢ Adding proper error handling and validation<br>â€¢ Converting hardcoded values to configurable parameters<br>â€¢ Improving code with type hints and docstrings<br>â€¢ Optimizing pandas operations for performance<br>â€¢ Adding comprehensive unit tests | *"Move this data preprocessing code into a separate function with type hints."*<br>*"Add error handling for missing files and invalid data types."*<br>*"Refactor this plotting code into a reusable visualization function."*<br>*"Convert these magic numbers into named constants."*<br>*"Write pytest tests for the feature engineering functions."*<br>*"Optimize this loop using vectorized pandas operations."* |
| **Agent** | â€¢ Scaffolding complete project structure with best practices<br>â€¢ Generating full-featured Streamlit/Flask applications<br>â€¢ Creating comprehensive test suites and CI/CD pipelines<br>â€¢ Building multi-model comparison frameworks<br>â€¢ Setting up professional packaging (pyproject.toml, Docker)<br>â€¢ Generating documentation and deployment guides | *"Create a complete Streamlit app for Titanic survival prediction with file upload, model training, and interactive visualization."*<br>*"Generate a professional Python package structure with src/ layout, tests, and CI/CD configuration."*<br>*"Build a model comparison framework that trains and evaluates multiple algorithms (LogisticRegression, RandomForest, XGBoost)."*<br>*"Create a comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, and data validation tests."*<br>*"Set up a Docker containerized deployment with FastAPI backend and React frontend."* |

> **Tip â€“ Mix & Match:**  
> â€¢ **Ask** for guidance â†’ **Edit** to apply changes â†’ **Agent** to scaffold whole features.  
> Switch modes fluidly as your task size grows.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using GitHub Codespaces with the included devcontainer configuration:

1. Click the **Code** button on the GitHub repository
2. Select **Codespaces** tab
3. Click **Create codespace on main**
4. Wait for the environment to set up automatically

The devcontainer includes:
- Python 3.11 with all required data science packages
- VS Code with Python, Jupyter, and GitHub Copilot extensions
- Pre-configured environment ready for the labs

### Option 2: Local Setup

If you prefer to work locally, follow the instructions in [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md).
